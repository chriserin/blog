# CSS color-mix function

[Since 2023](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_types_color_color-mix) you can use the
`color-mix` function to create new colors based on other colors.

```css
background-color: color-mix(in oklab, green, white);
```

The above will produce a lighter green, mixing 50% green with 50% white.

You can alter those percentages.

```css
background-color: color-mix(in oklab, green 40%, white 30%);
```

When the total is less than 100% the remainder is given to transparency. When
the total is above 100% the final listed value is reduced until 100% is the
total.

`oklab` is a color space. I found it was summed best [here](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/10484), which describes `oklab` as:

> the most useful and desired option, which is perceptually uniform mixing. In
> other words a 50-50 mix of two colors gives the color that looks halfway
> between them.
