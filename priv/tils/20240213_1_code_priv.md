# Read data from priv

When the `priv` directory is deployed, it may not be in the same relative
location as it is in project.

You can use `:code.priv_dir` with the name of your app as an argument to get
the location of the `priv` dir after deployment and in your dev env.

```
iex(1)> :code.priv_dir(:blog)
~c"/home/chris/projects/blog/_build/dev/lib/blog/priv"
```
